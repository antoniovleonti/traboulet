<h2>How to play</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>
To win Traboulet, you be the first to accomplish EITHER of the
following:<br>
- Capture 7 red marbles.<br>
- Make it impossible for your opponent to move (e.g. by capturing or
  surrounding all of their pieces).
</p>

<h3>Marble movement</h3>
<p>
The game takes place on a 7x7 board, and the movement of the marbles follows
strict rules:<br>
- You may only push your own color marbles (WHITE or BLACK).<br>
- A marble must have an empty slot behind it to be pushed (e.g. to push a
  marble NORTH, the slot to the SOUTH of the marble must be empty).<br>
- Marbles pushed into other marbles are pushed together.<br>
- You may never play a move that captures one of your own marbles.<br>
- You may not push your marble in the opposite direction it was pushed on your
  opponent's last move (more on this later [*]).<br>
</p>

<h3>Captures</h3>
<p>
Marbles are captured by simply pushing them off the board. Captured marbles
will never reenter the game. You can capture both red marbles and your
opponent's marbles. You cannot capture your own marbles.
</p>

<h3>Pushing back / "ko" [*]</h3>
<p>
Pushing your opponent around is an important and fun part of the game and
happens all the time. Understanding the specifics of what happens when you push
or get pushed is necessary for so many fundamental tactical ideas.
</p>

<p>
The rule is theoretically pretty simple: if your marble is pushed on your
opponent's turn, you can't push back FROM THAT MARBLE for one move.
</p>

<p>
Note the emphasis on "from that marble"... If a particular marble did not move
during your opponent's last move, you are still free to do whatever you like
with it, including push back if possible. This restriction only applies when
the marble you want to push is at the "back" of the chain and was pushed in the
opposite direction by your opponent.
</p>

<p>
Also, note that after you make some other move, if your opponent doesn't push
you again, you are perfectly free to push them back then. The restriction only
lasts for one move; only the last move is relevant in determining whether a
given move is legal.
</p>

<p>
Don't worry if you're confused. Just play a game and experiment and you'll
figure it out quickly.
</p>

<h3>Threefold repetition</h3>
<p>
While I've never seen it in a real game, theoretical draws do exist. While
there is no draw offer in this app, I've added a rule for threefold repetition.
If a POSITION (i.e., roughly, an arrangement of pieces and whose turn it is)
occurs three times, the game automatically marks it as a draw.
</p>

<h3>Basic strategy</h3>
<p>
Moves are a commodity in Traboulet. You only get so many of them, and your
marbles are quite slow-- they only ever move a single space per turn. In order
to win, you must spend as many of those precious moves as possible capturing
reds, setting yourself up to capture reds, and preventing your opponent from
capturing reds.
</p>

<p>
If you waste moves capturing your opponent's pieces, I hope your opponent is
also wasting their time too... I usually am quite happy when my opponent is
capturing my marble, because my best, most active marbles are usually not
available to be captured (or I've done something wrong!).
</p>

<p>
Also, games often end with very tactical, tricky endgames, so set yourself up
for success by activating your pieces and keeping them near the reds.
</p>

<p>
Good luck!
